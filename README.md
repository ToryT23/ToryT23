Hi 👋 My name is Tory Theus
===========================

I am software engineer!
-----------------------

It all started with a conversation on an assembly line. A co-worker and I were picking each others brain and somehow we got on the conversation of software development. I told him I had always been amazed at the endless possibilities of new creating things, but I didn't know how to get started. Four years later I have made them jump. I am excited to see what the future holds!

* 🌍  I'm based in Tennessee.
* 🧠  I'm learning C#
